# AI Face Recognition

### Libraries Used: OpenCV and face_recognition
### Programming Language Used: Python
Trained Using: Images added into the folder 'faces'


This project works by identifing faces from images and then searching for them using the local camera. 
If the faces match, the name of the person is indicated on the screen!

### Instructions

1) Clone the repository onto your personal computer
2) Ensure that Python is installed
3) Install OpenCV and face_recognition modules of Python
4) Create a directory 'faces' and upload png images of faces that you would like to train the model with
5) Set the camera device to '0' if using PC camera and '1' if using an external camera source
6) Run the program

P.S. Use editors such as Pycharm rather than VS Code for maximum efficiency. It might take some time to load if there are a large number of images uploaded.
